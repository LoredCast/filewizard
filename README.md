# File Wizard

File Wizard is a self-hosted, browser-based utility for file conversion, OCR, and audio transcription. It features a modern drag-and-drop interface and a powerful, asynchronous backend to handle long-running tasks without tying up the browser.

## Features

  * **Versatile File Conversion:** Easily convert between various file formats. The system is designed to be extended with any command-line tool (like FFmpeg, ImageMagick, etc.) via a simple `settings.yml` configuration file.
  * **High-Quality OCR:** Perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on PDFs and images to extract text.
  * **Accurate Audio Transcription:** Transcribe audio files into text using high-performance Whisper models.
  * **Modern UI & UX:**
      * Clean, responsive, dark-themed interface.
      * Drag-and-drop support for single or multiple files anywhere on the screen.
      * Traditional multi-file selection buttons.
      * A dialog to choose the desired action (Convert, OCR, Transcribe) for dropped files.
  * **Real-time Updates & History:**
      * Jobs are processed in the background, with the UI updating statuses in real-time via polling.
      * A persistent job history table displays file names, tasks, submission times, file sizes (input ‚Üí output), and final status.
      * Timestamps are automatically displayed in the user's local timezone.
      * Download links are provided for successfully processed files.
      * Pending or processing jobs can be cancelled.
  * **Easy Configuration:**
      * All tools, models, and application settings are managed in a human-readable `settings.yml` file.
      * A dedicated `/settings` page allows for viewing and editing the configuration directly from the UI.
